            <p align="left"><span style="color:black"> I am super-excited about using agentic simulations for treaty writing, high-stakes decision making, and negotiations. I view this as a strong application for the use of multiple agents in a sense that we can simulate the behavior of multiple parties in a negotiation. The idea is to use custom generative AI agents to brainstorm and solve and even negotiate complex problems in high-stakes contexts. By running thousands of such simulations, we extract distributions of negotiation variables such as Zone of Possible Agreement (ZOPA), Best Alternative to a Negotiated Agreement (BATNA), as well as identifying key leverage points, potential trade-offs, and optimum deal structures.

            <p><font color="black"> Well, that was me some time ago when I worked for the Max Planck Institute for Nuclear physics at Laboratori Nazionali del Gran Sasso in Italy (LNGS).<BR><p></p>
                <H3>Wet Science</H3>
                Those days I practiced what I call “Wet Physics” (ultralow background detection) at various locations, first in Canada working on the Sudbury Neutrino Observatory, then in Germany at the Max Planck Institute of International Studies (MPI-k), then Gran Sasso Labs on the Borexino experiment. This truly was “Wet Science” in the sense that the SNO experiment was a 10,000 ton heavy water detector located 2 km beneath the ground in a mine in Canada. So a lot of water. Borexino, a little smaller, but also a large detector filled with liquid (not water, but a liquid scintillator). We were super-excited that the Nobel Committee chose our project for the 2015 Nobel Prize. Icing on the cake was when we also won the 2016 Breakthrough Prize in Physics as well.
                <p></p>
                <H3> Dry Science Does NOT Mean Boring Science </H3>
                I moved to Princeton University Physics Department continuing to work on the Borexino experiment but met the amazing group of people at Princeton’s Program on Science and Global Security and in particular Prof. Frank von Hippel and I realized that the physics that I love can be applied to the greater good not just high energy physics. I then transitioned from “Wet Physics” to what I call “Dry Physics”. Not dry in the sense that it is boring, it is anything but. Rather applying physics to policy challenges in areas related to nuclear nonproliferation, nuclear weapons emerging technology etc. At the James Martin Center for Nonproliferation Studies (CNS) and the Middlebury Institute of International Studies at Monterey (MIIS), I instruct courses, on themes where Science and Policy intersect. I believe as Jonathan Foley, the executive director of the California Academy of Sciences, has said that a “healthy democracy depends on science” which is why I am keenly interested in science communication.
